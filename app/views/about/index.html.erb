    <div class="col-md-4">hey, my name is daniel.  i love to cook so my primary motivation going into this project was to build a recipe app that would help me write down recipes for various dishes i make at home.  i was also very interested in ruby/rails and have found learning these to be a very enjoyable experience.  the hope is that this can become a fully functional application that various people can use to facilitate recipe writing as well as discovering new ingredients or techniques.</div>
